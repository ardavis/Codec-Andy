This codec is meant to compress and decompress image files using the Shannon-Fano algorithm.

If you have any questions, please contact Andrew Davis at andrew@andrewrdavis.net


The Header of the encoded file should look like:

Shannon-Fano or Huffman (One word only)
BEGIN
  001 - 62,41,93        (RGB)
  011 - 49,101,255
  etc
END

From Adam:

In a hash, you could have "rv,gv,bv" as the key, then the count as the value


column_1, column_2 = pixel_hash.enum_slice((pixel_hash.size / 2.0).round).to_a
except pixels instead of artists
